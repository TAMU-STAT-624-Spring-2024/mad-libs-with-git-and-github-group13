Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Groot,

I am writing to you from a enormous spaceship in a distant galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a purple rocket in May. There are one and a half meteorological anomalies and sausage links of a sense of confusion here! In the
introspection chamber there is a pool full of oil. I fall asleep each night on a big bed of
sponge and dream of eating non-stop. It feels as though I have lived here for
13 megaseconds. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
spelunking on a loquacious space shuttle!!

Best wishes,
Chris
