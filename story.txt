going for a ride on a [4] rocket in [5]. There are [6] [7] and [8] of [9] here! In the
[10] there is a pool full of [11]. I fall asleep each night on a [12] bed of
[13] and dream of [14] [15]. It feels as though I have lived here for
[16] [17]. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is

Best wishes,
