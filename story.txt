Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Groot,

I am writing to you from a enormous spaceship in a distant galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a purple rocket in May. There are one and a half meteorological anomalies and sausage links of a sense of confusion here! In the
introspection chamber there is a pool full of [11]. I fall asleep each night on a [12] bed of
[13] and dream of [14] [15]. It feels as though I have lived here for
13 megaseconds. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
spelunking on a loquacious space shuttle!!

Best wishes,
Chris
